### KinetBet

This is a safe space focused on creating a culture of healing through mindfulness, conversation and art by always operating with love and compassion. We will be discussing topics that make us uncomfortable but through the discomfort, we will build the culture of healing we so desperately need. So come in, take several deep breaths and let’s get together to challenge what we’ve been thought, unlearn then learn what we need to be the best version of ourselves.
